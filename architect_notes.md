# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
- Step 90: Review 'checklist.md' for remaining uncompleted tasks. Log outstanding tasks in 'architect_notes.md' under 'Remaining Features and Tasks'.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
- Step 91: Analyze all project files for redundancies and structure. Identified issues include:
  - Multiple components in the GUI folder have similar paint and resize methods that could be refactored into a base class to reduce code duplication.
  - The checklist files contain repetitive steps that could be consolidated to streamline the process.
  - The README.md and design_functional_vision.md files have overlapping content regarding the project structure and features, which could be summarized in one document to avoid redundancy.

## Bugs and Functional Issues
- Step 92: Identify and resolve bugs affecting completed features. Document any unresolved bugs in 'architect_notes.md' under 'Bugs and Functional Issues'.
