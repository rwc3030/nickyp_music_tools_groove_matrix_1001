# GrooveMatrix Design Functional Vision

## Visual Style
The GrooveMatrix interface features a striking obsidian background, accented with dynamic cyan and amber highlights that respond to rhythm intensity and pattern complexity.

## UI Layout
The layout is centered around the groundbreaking Rhythm DNA Sequencer, which visualizes patterns as interconnected nodes within a three-dimensional grid. This allows for intuitive manipulation of timing, velocity, and groove characteristics through a revolutionary orbital control system that responds to both mouse and touch input with precise haptic feedback.
